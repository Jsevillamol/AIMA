Artificial Intelligence Programming Practice

This repository is used to store the algorithms I develop as I advance with my self-study of *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*, by S. Russell and P. Norvig.

It contains:
##Environments
A collection of toy environments for agent programs.
Currently not working.

##Search
A collection of general purpose search algorithms, together with search problems to practice.

**Blind Algorithms** search without distinguising states other than goal_states. Currently implemented: Breadth-First Graph Search, Loop Free Iterative Deepening Search, Bidirectional Bread First Graph Search.

In **problems** you will find examples of search problems to be used by the search algorithms. All problems inherit from the base class Problem. Currently implemented: 15-puzzle, Cannibals and Missionaries.
